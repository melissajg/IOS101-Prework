## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

APP IDEA: An app that manages your borrowing and lending activities and promotes commmunity bonds by encouraging sharing within your neighborhood.
- Personal tracker that documents what a user is currently borrowing from another user (or lending out) and other related details inclduing who is borrowing it, when it was loaned out, when it is due to be return, item description, picture of item, etc. 
- History page that documents all past exchnages (loans/borrows).
- Users who have items that they are willing/ interested in loaning out and can make a post about it publicly visible for people nerby to know that it is availble to borrow. Post will contain details about the item as well as the lending conditions/requirements decided upon by the lender but can be negotiated/editted.
- Lenders can choose what individuals/ group of individuals can see any particular item post.
- Users can search by item name and can filter/sort results.
- User have a personal profile that contains contect info, personal details, and their rating as a lender and borrower.
- Lenders and borrowers can rate and review their experience with the item and other partipcating party to establish credibility on both ends.
- User can decide if/when to disclosed/hide their location/address to borrowers so borrower can pick up item. Lender and borrower can decided on a agreed upon location together.
- User can take a picture/video of item before/after they loan it out and borrwer can (or be required to by lender due to agreed upon lending condtions) to take a picture/video of item before and after use. All pictures and photos info will be saved in a gallery in app for future reference.
-  Lender can create/customize their lending preconditions to their preferences so they feel secure in lending out items and have a safeguard in place if item is not returned or is damaged.
- App can track and record location of lended item(s) through connection with a tracker tag that can be placed on item.
- (Futue Feature) App will have safe and secure pickup/drop off locations/ lockers (similar to amazon locakers) so loaners and borrowers are not required to meet face to face.

## Notes

Only difficulty was a slight confusion about how to get the direct link to gif (that ends with .gif) from imgur instead of the embedded link which is was imgur provides when you copy link.
